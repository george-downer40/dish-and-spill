The purpose of this website is to showcase the restaurant ‘Dish & Spill’. The restaurant is focussed around a community feel with an emphasis on ‘family style’ eating. This sets the restaurant apart from other locations and the website is designed to emphasise that community feel. It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly, allowing visitors to easily learn about the restaurant, its menu, and its community purpose.
