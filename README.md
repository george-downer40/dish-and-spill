# Dish & Spill

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this website is to showcase the restaurant ‘Dish & Spill’. It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly, allowing visitors to easily learn about the restaurant, its menu, and its community purpose.  

## User stories
As a visiting user, I want to learn about the restaurant, in particular the food served, the location of the restaurant and its opening times, so that I can decide if this is a somewhere I would like to eat, and if its opening times align with my upcoming plans.
As a returning customer (assuming I have dined here before), I want to check if there are any new additions to the seasonal menu, and that the opening times are still viable for my schedule.
As an individual, business or member of a community group who has found this site due to searching for information on either community venues or combatting loneliness, I want to learn more about the community aspect of the restaurant so that I make a decision as to whether I would like to become involved in that aspect of the restaurant.

## Features

The Dish & Spill title in the header will always link back to the home page.
The map on the homepage will show the location of the restaurant. The map can be selected to open google maps in a separate window.
