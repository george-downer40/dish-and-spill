The purpose of this website is to showcase the restaurant ‘Dish & Spill’. The restaurant is focussed around a community feel with an emphasis on ‘family style’ eating. This sets the restaurant apart from other locations and the website is designed to emphasise that community feel. It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly, allowing visitors to easily learn about the restaurant, its menu, and its community purpose.

## User Stories

* As a visiting user, I want to learn about the restaurant, in particular the food served, the location of the restaurant and its opening times, so that I can decide if this is a somewhere I  would like to eat, and if its opening times align with my upcoming plans.
* As a returning customer (assuming I have dined here before), I want to check if there are any new additions to the seasonal menu, and that the opening times are still viable for my schedule.
* As a visiting user who is looking for something different to a standard restaurant I want to learn more about the community aspect of Dish & Spill.

* Form Submission Page
    * The contact form links to a form submission page thanking the user for leaving feedback. This allows the user to return to either the index page or another page rather than being stuck on a thank you page.
