        <h2>About Dish & Spill</h2>
        <p class="about-para">
            Dish & Spill is a London based restaurant established in 2021, created to offer delicious food and be a
            place to
            share a bit of love and kindness.
            Here at Dish & Spill we sit together and laugh together. Our restaurant offers large table dining and we
            encourage you to order sharing dishes with your friends and eat together “family style” – the way people
            always
            used to.
            Don’t think you need a big group to enjoy our food. We offer tables for solo diners to come and try our food
            at
            our community tables and hopefully meet someone new and interesting. If you are very shy fear not, we also
            have
            smaller tables if you’d rather keep to yourself (we’re not mean!).
            We look forward to welcoming you to our table and hope you share in the joy of conversation and community
            just
            as much as we do.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
            Loneliness is a feeling that we have all felt but some feel this way most days. Loneliness and social
            isolation
            can increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes and studies have shown that it is even worse for your
            body
            than obesity. That is why we encourage you to stop by and say hello, whether you are alone or with friends,
            for
            a bite to eat and maybe a tipple or two. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but we hear a fantastic
            plate
            of food and a gossip may just be that one step better.
