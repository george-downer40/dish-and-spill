        <h2>About Dish & Spill</h2>
        Dish & Spill is a London based restaurant established in 2021, created to offer delicious food and be a place to share a bit of love and kindness. 
        Here at Dish & Spill we sit together and laugh together. Our restaurant offers large table dining and we encourage you to order sharing dishes with your friends and eat together “family style” – the way people always used to. 
        Don’t think you need a big group to enjoy our food. We offer tables for solo diners to come and try our food at our community tables and hopefully meet someone new and interesting. If you are very shy fear not, we also have smaller tables if you’d rather keep to yourself (we’re not mean!). 
        We look forward to welcoming you to our table and hope you share in the joy of conversation and community just as much as we do.
